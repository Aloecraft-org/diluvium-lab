# Diluvium Lab — Roadmap

Seed document for a **separate repository**. Diluvium Lab is a notebook
front end for Diluvium: cells, a console, kernel controls, running against
a Diluvium WASM build in the page.

It consumes published Diluvium releases and never builds Diluvium itself.
That keeps the two efforts independent, and it means the mechanism the Lab
needs anyway — fetch a release, load it, run it — is also its own dev
workflow.

Update this document in the same commit as the work it describes.

---

## 1. Where this starts from

The good news is concrete: **an MVP needs no changes to Diluvium.**

`src/wasm_stubs.c` in the Diluvium tree exports `init_lua()` and
`run_lua(code)` against a **persistent `global_L`** carrying the full
standard library. State survives between calls. That is a kernel already,
and persistent cross-cell state is the one property a notebook genuinely
needs and the most expensive one to bolt on later.

### The artifact to load

Three WASM files ship on the releases page. They are not
interchangeable:

| Artifact | What it is | Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `libdiluvium_wasi.wasm` | linked `--no-entry --allow-undefined`; exports `init_lua`, `run_lua`, `malloc`, `free`, `memory` and the whole Lua C API | **this is the kernel** |
| `diluvium_wasi.wasm` | command module; runs `main` and the REPL from `_start` | not for the Lab |
| `diluvium_compiler_wasi.wasm` | `luac` | **not needed** — see below |

Both are **WASI** builds, not `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The
`wasm32-unknown-unknown` target exists in the Makefile but only produces a
static archive (`libdiluvium_wasm_unknown.a`), never a linked `.wasm`, so
it is not a browser option today. The browser must therefore supply WASI
imports.

### What the binary actually says

Inspected from `v5.4.7_release`, `libdiluvium_wasi.wasm`
(sha256 `c3da069e…`, 895 771 bytes), by parsing its import and export
sections. These are facts about the shipped artifact, not expectations:

- **45 imports, every one of them plain `wasi_snapshot_preview1`** —
  `fd_*`, `path_*`, `clock_*`, `args_*`, `environ_*`, `sock_*`,
  `poll_oneoff`, `proc_exit`, `random_get`, `sched_yield`. Nothing
  custom. **An off-the-shelf preview1 shim covers it**; no bespoke shim is
  needed, which removes most of the risk Stage 0 was meant to price.
- **`_start` *is* exported**, alongside `init_lua` and `run_lua`. The
  module is linked `--no-entry` but still carries the command entry
  point. Do not call it — it runs the REPL against stdin. Call the
  exports directly.
- **`_initialize` is absent; `__wasm_call_ctors` is exported.** So this is
  *not* a canonical WASI reactor, and nothing initialises libc on your
  behalf. **Call `__wasm_call_ctors()` once, before `init_lua()`.**
  Skipping it leaves libc stdio uninitialised and `init_lua`'s `setvbuf`
  is the first thing to touch it. This is the single most likely way to
  lose an afternoon in Stage 0.
- **`diluvium_generate_report` is exported from this same module**, so the
  analysis-report and determinism-verdict panel needs no second module and
  no `diluvium_compiler_wasi.wasm`. That makes it much cheaper than
  assumed and it can land whenever it is wanted.
- **`luaL_newstate` and the rest of the C API are exported.** A future
  kernel could create and destroy states directly instead of
  re-instantiating the module for a restart.
- **stdout and stderr arrive as `fd_write` on fd 1 and 2**, so output
  capture and the stream split come free from the shim rather than
  needing anything from the runtime.
- `SHA256SUMS.txt` lists `libdiluvium_wasi.wasm` and the published hash
  matches the downloaded bytes, so the Stage 2 integrity check works
  against releases as they exist today.

### What a notebook needs, and where it comes from

| Need | Today |
| :--- | :--- |
| Persistent state across cells | free — `global_L` |
| Output, with streams separated | WASI `fd_write` on fd 1 and 2 |
| Expression echo (`1+1` → `2`) | `run_lua` uses `luaL_dostring`, which does not echo. Do the REPL's "retry with `return` prepended" trick host-side |
| Restart kernel | re-instantiate the module — cleaner than a reset export, and a true restart |
| Completion | inject a Lua completion function and call it through `run_lua`; matches the handoff's "completion logic is written in Lua and embedded" |
| Errors | `run_lua` prints `Error: ...` to stdout and returns non-zero. Parse host-side for now; structured errors when the real protocol lands |
| **Interrupt** | **not possible.** `run_lua` is a synchronous WASM call and nothing can preempt it. See §6 |

## 2. Build or adopt

Diluvium Lab is close to what **JupyterLite** already is: JupyterLab
compiled to run entirely in-browser, WASM kernels, static hosting,
`File > New > Notebook`, console, kernel controls.

The decision is **not to adopt it now, and not to foreclose it.** The app
shell — file browser, tabs, launcher, settings — is the most expensive and
least differentiated part of what we would otherwise build. If we ever
want it, buying it beats building it. But adopting it now means writing
against `@jupyterlite/kernel` interfaces before Diluvium's own kernel
framing has settled, and that ordering is backwards.

Two hooks keep the door open at near-zero cost, and both are decided:

1. **Store `.ipynb`.** It is JSON with a published schema. It buys GitHub
   rendering, `nbconvert`, portability both directions with real Jupyter,
   and it means no one's files are stranded by a later migration. There is
   no good reason to invent a format.
2. **Shape kernel messages like Jupyter's** — `execute_request` /
   `execute_reply`, `stream`, `error`, `status`, `complete_request`,
   `is_complete_request`. This is nearly the same message set the Diluvium
   handoff already specifies for its REPL protocol (`execute`,
   `complete(buffer, cursor)`, `reset`, streamed stdout/stderr). Aligning
   them costs nothing now and turns "adopt JupyterLite" into an adapter
   rather than a rewrite.

---

## 3. This is not a detour

The Diluvium handoff lists notebook architecture as "design after kernel
framing settles". The dependency runs the other way in practice.

**The Lab is the best pressure test the REPL/kernel protocol will get, and
gaps are far cheaper to find here than in the native REPL.** Completion
semantics, streaming, restart, error framing, interrupt — a notebook
exercises all of them under real use, months before the native REPL
depends on any of it. Building against a provisional shim now and swapping
in the real protocol at Stage 3 is a sequencing win.

The Lab is also the natural home for the analysis report and the
determinism verdict. *Run cell → see the verdict* is a demo no other
notebook can give, and it is exactly the playground artifact's pitch.

---

## 4. Stages

Each stage is independently usable. Stopping after any of them leaves
something worth having.

### Stage 0 — Spike

One HTML file. Load `libdiluvium_wasi.wasm`, instantiate with a WASI
shim, run one hard-coded snippet, show its output.

Not the product — a **go/no-go on one remaining unknown**.

The import question is already answered (§1): 45 standard
`wasi_snapshot_preview1` imports, so a stock preview1 shim suffices.
What is left is the one that can invalidate the approach:

- **Does `setjmp`/`longjmp` work in the browser?** See §6. Test it
  first, with a `pcall` that actually catches an error — a happy path
  proves nothing here.

Order of operations, which is not guessable from the outside:
instantiate → `__wasm_call_ctors()` → `init_lua()` → `run_lua(ptr)`,
with the code string written into `memory` via the exported `malloc`.

Ends with a Playwright test that loads the page, runs the snippet, and
asserts on the output. That test is the harness every later stage reuses.

### Stage 1 — The usable notebook

**The target to reach and then live with for a while.** Everything here
works against today's releases.

- Code and markdown cells; run cell, run all, add / delete / reorder
- Expression echo, so cells behave the way people expect
- A console pane sharing the kernel — scratch execution outside the document
- Restart kernel
- `.ipynb` load and save; file download and upload; autosave to IndexedDB
- Output caps per cell, with a "show all" escape

This is genuinely pleasant for prototyping Diluvium and asks nothing of
the runtime.

### Stage 2 — Version switching

The dropdown, and more valuable than it looks: running one notebook
against two builds is precisely what a language author wants, and no
general-purpose notebook offers it.

- GitHub Releases API, with the response cached (60 requests/hour
  unauthenticated is easy to exhaust on reloads)
- Downloaded modules cached in Cache API or IndexedDB — not a fresh
  megabyte per reload
- **Integrity checked against `SHA256SUMS.txt`**, which the Diluvium build
  already produces. The Lab fetches and executes a binary at runtime; this
  costs little and matters for a tool people paste code into
- A **capability probe**: builds older than whatever protocol we settle on
  must fail with a clear "this build is too old", never fail strangely
- Optionally mirror artifacts on aloecraft.org, which sidesteps the API
  rate limit and gives a stable fallback if GitHub is unreachable

### Stage 3 — A second kernel backend

Local `diluvium` over WebSocket, or a hosted endpoint. By now the adapter
exists, so this is additive rather than surgical. This is also where the
real REPL protocol replaces the `run_lua` shim.

A **local** kernel — connect to Diluvium running on your own machine — is
probably more useful than a hosted one and is already on the Diluvium
roadmap as the v1.2 remote REPL. No infra, no auth, no abuse surface.
On-page WASM stays the default and the thing that always works with zero
setup; other backends are escape hatches for capabilities a browser
cannot provide.

### Stage 4 — Workspace shell

Multiple notebooks, file tree, tabs, `File > New`.

**This is the JupyterLite decision point.** By then a kernel adapter
exists — the reusable part — so the bespoke work is not wasted either
way, and the choice can be made on evidence instead of prediction.

---

## 5. Decided

- Separate repository; consumes published releases, never builds Diluvium
- `.ipynb` as the storage format
- Jupyter-shaped kernel messages
- A kernel interface with one implementation behind it **from Stage 1** —
  the version dropdown, hosted mode, local mode and JupyterLite all become
  instances of one abstraction instead of four retrofits. This is the
  single highest-leverage structural choice in the project
- On-page WASM is the default backend
- `libdiluvium_wasi.wasm` is the kernel artifact

## 6. Risks and gotchas

**The pinned runtime is 5.4.7, and that is deliberate.** The Diluvium
Makefile pins the wasi-sdk container by digest, and that digest is
byte-identical between `v5.4.7_release` and current 5.5 work — so the
exception-handling lowering Stage 0 tests is produced by exactly the same
toolchain that will build the 5.5 artifacts. **The answer transfers.**

The consequence is that the pinned runtime does not have the 5.5 language
work (`switch`, compound assignment, the rewritten f-strings). Sample
notebooks in `notebooks/` must stay within 5.4.7 syntax or they fail
confusingly on first run. When a 5.5 artifact publishes, add a *second*
notebook that uses the new constructs: switching between the two is then
the natural Stage 2 demo.

**`setjmp`/`longjmp` is the real Stage 0 risk.** Lua implements error
handling with `longjmp`, and the WASM builds use LLVM's WASM SJLJ
(`-mllvm -wasm-enable-sjlj -mllvm -wasm-use-legacy-eh=false`), which
lowers onto the WebAssembly exception-handling proposal — and specifically
the *final* opcodes, not the legacy ones. Browser support for final EH is
more recent than for legacy. If it does not work, `pcall` and every error
message break, and the options are a rebuild with legacy EH, a browser
floor, or the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target getting a real linked
artifact. **Test this before anything else, with an error that must be
caught, not just a happy path.**

**Interrupt has three tiers, and the middle one conflicts with a goal.**
- *No interrupt* (Stage 1). Honest, and fine to start.
- *Worker + SharedArrayBuffer*, which the Diluvium handoff assumes.
  SAB requires cross-origin isolation (COOP/COEP). **GitHub Pages cannot
  set those headers** — there is a service-worker workaround, but it is a
  hack — and a page opened from `file://` can never be isolated. So this
  tier is incompatible with the standalone-page goal.
- *Fuel-stepped*: run N instructions, return to the event loop, resume.
  Works everywhere, no headers, no SAB, no isolation. It is the same
  instruction-budget mechanism Diluvium wants for cooperative scheduling.
  **This is the tier that makes the standalone page work**, and a reason
  for that runtime work to land sooner.

**Hosting choice constrains the above.** Decide early whether the Lab is
served cross-origin-isolated; it is annoying to change later.

**Output volume.** One cell printing a million lines kills the tab. Cap
lines and bytes per cell from Stage 1 — cheap, and easy to forget until it
ruins a demo.

**IndexedDB, not localStorage.** 5 MB dies quickly once notebooks carry
saved output.

**Kernel restart leaks** unless module and instance references are
dropped. Each restart allocates a fresh linear memory.

## 7. Non-goals

- No Python, no Pyodide — a later experiment in the Diluvium docs, not here
- No collaboration or multi-user
- No virtual filesystem in v1
- No language server
- Do not fork JupyterLab. Adopt it whole, or not at all

## 8. Open

- Repository name, and where it is hosted
- Whether the standalone single-file page is a hard requirement or a
  nice-to-have — it is the single biggest constraint, since it rules out
  SAB-based interrupt and points at the fuel-stepped path
- Editor: a plain `<textarea>` is enough for Stage 1; CodeMirror is the
  obvious upgrade but is the first real dependency. Diluvium syntax
  highlighting exists in the browser REPL's PrismJS setup and could be
  reused
- Whether the analysis report / determinism verdict panel lands at Stage 2
  or Stage 3, and whether it uses `diluvium_compiler_wasi.wasm` as a second
  module or waits for the report to come through the kernel
